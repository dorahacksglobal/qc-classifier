# qc-classifier
AI-inspired Classification of Quantum Computers
Current benchmark is 63% with the current combination of features. When four lines are concatenated together, it reaches 79%. 

This configuration has six tests - 'spectral_test', 'shannon_entropy', 'frequency_test', 'runs_test', 'autocorrelation', and min_entropy. Many other combinations of tests have not been tested, as well as certain adjustments to the models. The current two highest results come from the Grandient Booster, followed by the Random Forest.
